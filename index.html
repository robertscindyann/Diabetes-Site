          <h2>What is Diabetes?</h2>
          <p>It’s a condition that changes how the body turns food into energy. Food is broken down into
            sugar (glucose) and its travels to the bloodstream. This signals the pancreas to release insulin, it
            acts
            like a key and allows sugar to enter cells to use as energy. </p>
          <p>Overtime,the body stops responding to insulin and sugar builds up in the blood stream. Serious health
            problems such as: vision loss, kidney disease and heart disease can occur.
          </p>


          <h3>Three Main Types of Diabetes</h3>
          <h4>Type 1</h4>
          <p>The pancreas doesn’t produce insulin or produces very little of it. Cells responsible for making insulin
            are
            destroyed.</p>

          <h4>Type 2</h4>
          <p>The body doesn’t use insulin properly, this is know as insulin resistance.</p>

          <h4>Gestational</h4>
          <p>Develops during pregnancy and usually return to normal after delivery.</p>


          <h3>Can Type 2 Diabetes be Prevented?</h3>
          <p>Lifestyle changes such as getting more physical
            activity and choosing superfoods instead of junk food can prevent or delay diabetes.</p>

              <p>Is a hormone made by the pancreas in response to elevated glucose in the blood after you eat. Insulin
                acts as the key which unlocks the cell to allow glucose to enter the cell and be used for energy. </p>

          <h3>How the Body Turn Food Into Energy</h3>
          <p>Cells need a constant supply of energy, this energy comes from the food we eat. Food is made up of
            proteins,
            lipids and polysaccharides (many sugars). </p>
          <p>The body breaks down protein into amino acids, lipids into fatty acids and polysaccharides into
            sugars.</p>
          <p>
            Fats
            protect our nerves and is important for hormone production. Amino acids are the building block of
            proteins
            and sugars (glucose) travel to our cells for energy.
          </p>

          <h4>If proteins are broken down into amino acids, how does it turn back into protein?</h4>
          <p>Our body breaks down the proteins we eat and changes it into a protein our body can use. </p>

        <h2>How Diabetes affects the body</h2>
        <p>Glucose can’t enter the cells, so sugar builds up in the bloodstream. Over time this is called
          hyperglycemia
